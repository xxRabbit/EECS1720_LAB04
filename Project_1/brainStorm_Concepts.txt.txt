Project 1 Web Extension project brainstorm.
Entertainment spectrum ?
1. A quick finder tool that can pick html rgb colors?
- cuts out the google search for a color picker.
- easily accessible to change code on github webbroswer ?

2. Count Down timer, stop watch for virtual games on zoom/discord?
- can be used for playing a group game that is hosted on zoom on discord,
where everyone can access a countdown timer/stop watch directly from their browser via the extension. 
Can be used For games such as: 
Charades.
Minute to Win it.
Scavanger Hunts.
Name that Song/Tune/Movie.

Can be as simple as a countdown timer while taking a timed quiz that does not have countdown timer.

What to implement into the countdown time/stopwatch
- Ticking noise that can be turned off or on.
- Change the visuals of the timer for a more personal touch.
- A jingle to be played when time is up.
